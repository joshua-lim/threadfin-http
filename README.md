# threadfin-http
This is an experimental HTTP server built using Node.JS. 
threadfin-http allows you to host static HTML and REST API. It provides feature such such as HTTP response compression (deflate/gzip), Authentication and configurable document root to meet your basic need as a web server.   

Subsequently, I have also added features such as reverse proxy and prometheus integration.

# Installation
Run npm install threadfin-http to download the latest package.


# Usage
Execute node server.js

Configuration are stored in config.json.
